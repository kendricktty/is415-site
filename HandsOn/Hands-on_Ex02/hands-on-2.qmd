# H2.1 Overview

While thematic mapping uses map symbols to visualise geographic properties such as population and temperature, geovisualisation is a subset of thematic mapping, where a pseudocolour is used to correspond with these geographic properties.

# H2.2 Getting Started

`tmap` contains the packages needed to perform geovisualisation, so we need to import that along with the usual packages we use.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```
