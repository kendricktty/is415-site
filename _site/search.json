    "text": "H1.1 Overview\nAs adapted from the course website:\nGeospatial Data Science is a process of importing, wrangling, integrating, and processing geographically referenced data sets. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to perform geospatial data science tasks in R by using sf package.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you should acquire the following competencies:\n\ninstalling and loading sf and tidyverse packages into R environment,\nimporting geospatial data by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nimporting aspatial data by using appropriate function of readr package,\nexploring the content of simple feature data frame by using appropriate Base R and sf functions,\nassigning or transforming coordinate systems by using using appropriate sf functions,\nconverting an aspatial data into a sf data frame by using appropriate function of sf package,\nperforming geoprocessing tasks by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nperforming data wrangling tasks by using appropriate functions of dplyr package and\nperforming Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by using appropriate functions from ggplot2 package.\n\n\nNote: Students are encouraged to read the reference guide of each function, especially the input data requirements, syntaxt and argument option before using them.\n\n\n\nH1.2 Data acquisition\nTo complete this exercise, the following datasets were downloaded and extracted:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\n\n\nH1.3 Getting Started\nIn this hands-on exercise, two R packages were used. They are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data."
