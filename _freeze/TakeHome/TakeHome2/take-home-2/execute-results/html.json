Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. The UNODC has reported an increase in the number of people using illicit drugs to 292 million people worldwide in the decade leading up to 2022. Of these, 228 million people consumed cannabis, 60 million people consumed opiods, 30 million used amphetamines, 23 million used cocaine and 20 million took ecstasy. Further, they found an **increase in overdose deaths following the emergence of nitazenes**, which is a group of synthetic opioids potentially more dangerous than fentanyl – in several high-income countries. (World Drug Day Report Highlights Spike in Drug Use, Increased Trafficking | UN News, 2024).\n\nThe aim of today's study is to discover:\n\n- If the key indicators of drug abuse in **[Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand)** are independent from space,\n- If the indicators of drug abuse are indeed spatially-dependent, and if so, where the clusters, outliers and hotspots are located,\n- How the observations above evolve over time.\n\n## TH2.2 The Drug Problem in Thailand\n\n**Thailand** (2024 GDP per capita - PPP: $23,401; Gini coefficient: 35.1 - <span style=\"color:orange;\">medium</span>; HDI: 0.083 - <span style=\"color:darkgreen;\">very high</span>) (International Monetary Fund, 2024) (World Bank, n.d.) (United Nations Development Programme, 2024) is located in close proximity to the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)), which comprises the northern part of the country along with northern Myanmar and Laos. In 2021, its drug trafficking situation remained critical, with 337,186 drug cases in total. While seizures of ketamine decreased between 2020 and 2021, seizures of methamphetamine, ice and heroin increased in the same period, with heroin seeing the biggest increase from 1873kg in 2020 to 4520kg in 2021 (Kongjareon et al., 2022).\n\nThe maximum penalty for drug trafficking in Thailand, as is neighbouring Laos, Malaysia and Singapore, is [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_for_drug_trafficking) (Thailand, n.d.). Despite this, drug trafficking persists in the country, with smugglers finding new routes through the north and northern borders of the country, even going so far as to hide shipments in cargo vessels bound for the likes of Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and South Korea. 575 smuggling cases by sea occured in 2021, in which 4554kg of heroin, 2.4 times more than the previous year, were seized (Kongjareon et al., 2022).\n\nDrug *use* in the country is as problematic. In 2018, 39% of Thais aged between 15 and 24 were involved in ilicit drugs. Of youth aged between 15 and 19, there are 300000 who need treatment, and a significant majority attend vocational schools (as opposed to grade schools). Kongjareon et al. (2022) found in a study of 638 students in four vocational schools, 11.3% reported poly-drug use. Among LGBT students this figure was 20.2%, and among hetrosexual students 9.8%. Factors contributing to the former's use of drugs include, among other things, counselling needs, intoxicated sex and GPA.\n\n## TH2.3 Importing data and R packages\n\nThe `R` packages we will use today are:\n\n-   `sf`\n-   `tmap`\n-   `spatstat`\n-   `spdep` for measures of spatial autocorrelation, and\n-   `sparr`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, raster, spatstat, spdep, sparr, tmap, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe will be examining a dataset of drug offences in Thailand between 2017 and 2022, superimposed against the provincial boundaries of the country.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthailand <- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\", layer=\"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121' from data source \n  `/Users/kendricktty/Gits/SMU_CS/is415-site/TakeHome/TakeHome2/data/geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthailand_drug <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 7392 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): types_of_drug_offenses, province_th, province_en\ndbl (2): fiscal_year, no_cases\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## TH2.4\n\n## References\n\n1.
