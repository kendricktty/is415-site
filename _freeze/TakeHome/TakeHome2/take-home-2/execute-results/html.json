Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. The UNODC has reported an increase in the number of people using illicit drugs to 292 million people worldwide in the decade leading up to 2022. Of these, 228 million people consumed cannabis, 60 million people consumed opiods, 30 million used amphetamines, 23 million used cocaine and 20 million took ecstasy. Further, they found an **increase in overdose deaths following the emergence of nitazenes**, which is a group of synthetic opioids potentially more dangerous than fentanyl â€“ in several high-income countries. (World Drug Day Report Highlights Spike in Drug Use, Increased Trafficking | UN News, 2024).\n\nThe aim of today's study is to discover:\n\n- If the key indicators of drug abuse in **Thailand** are independent from space,\n- If the indicators of drug abuse are indeed spatially-dependent, and if so, where the clusters, outliers and hotspots are located,\n- How the observations above evolve over time.\n\n## TH2.2 The Drug Problem in Thailand\n\n**Thailand** (2024 GDP per capita - PPP: $23,401; Gini coefficient: 35.1 - <span style=\"color:orange;\">medium</span>; HDI: 0.083 - <span style=\"color:darkgreen;\">very high</span>) (International Monetary Fund, 2024) (World Bank, n.d.) (United Nations Development Programme, 2024) is located in close proximity to the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)), which comprises the northern part of the country along with northern Myanmar and Laos. In 2018, 39% of Thais aged between 15 and 24 are involved in ilicit drugs. Of youth aged between 15 and 19, there are 300000 who need treatment, and a significant majority attend vocational schools (as opposed to grade schools). Kongjareon et al. (2022) found \n\nThe penalty for drug trafficking in Thailand, much like neighbouring Laos, Malaysia and Singapore, is [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_for_drug_trafficking).
