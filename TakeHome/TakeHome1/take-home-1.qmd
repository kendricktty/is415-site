## TH1.1 Setting the Scene

Millions of people have their lives shattered by armed conflict every year. One of these is the [**Myanmar Civil War**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present)), a significant escalation of the long-running [Myanmar Conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_conflict) in response to the [2021 coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).

Geospatial analtyics holds the potential to address complex problems facing society, such as this one. This study serves to discover the sptial and spatio-temporal distribution (spread) of the armed conflict in Myanmar by applying spatial point patterns analysis methods.

## TH1.2 The Data

Armed conflict data in Myanmar between 2021 and 2024 was downloaded from the [Armed Conflict Location & Event Database (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/), an independent, impartial, international non-profit organization collecting data on violent conflicts and protests in all countries and territories in the world. We will be superimposing these locations with the geogrpahical boundary and subdivisions of the country, from the **Myanmar Information Management Unit** (MIMU)

## TH1.3 Importing and transforming armed conflict data and administrative boundary data into `sf` `tibble` `data.frames`

### TH1.3.1 Loading R packages and aspatial data

The `R` packages we will use today are:

- `sf`
- `tmap`
- `spatstat`
- `raster`
- `maptools`

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, raster, spatstat, tmap, tidyverse)
acled_mya <- read_csv("data/ACLED_Myanmar.csv")
acled_mya
```

### TH1.3.2 Loading geospatial data

Three representations of Myanmar's geography exist on  - `Admin1` subdivides the country into its states and regions only, while `Admin2` subdivides the country by its smaller districts, and `Admin3` its townships. Further, the ACLED labels each incident with all 3 representations. For simplicity and ease of understanding, we shall use the `Admin1` representation.

```{r}
mmr_admin1 <- st_read(dsn="data/mmr_polbnda_adm1_250k_mimu_1", layer="mmr_polbnda_adm1_250k_mimu_1")
mmr_admin1
qtm(mmr_admin1)
```

### TH1.3.3 Creating simple feature data frame from aspatial data

The ACLED data contains coordinates, making it useful for plotting on our map as points. We can therefore use it to create a simple feature data frame

```{r}

```
