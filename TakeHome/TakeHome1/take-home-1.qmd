## TH1.1 Setting the Scene

Millions of people have their lives shattered by armed conflict every year. One of these is the [**Myanmar Civil War**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present)), a significant escalation of the long-running [Myanmar Conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_conflict) in response to the [2021 coup d'etat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).

Geospatial analtyics holds the potential to address complex problems facing society, such as this one. This study serves to discover the sptial and spatio-temporal distribution (spread) of the armed conflict in Myanmar by applying spatial point pattern analysis (SPPA) methods.

### TH1.1.1 Loading R packages

The `R` packages we will use today are:

- `sf`
- `tmap`
- `spatstat`
- `sparr`
- `raster`
- `maptools`

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, raster, spatstat, sparr, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## TH1.2 The Data

Armed conflict data in Myanmar between 2010 and 2023 was downloaded from the [Armed Conflict Location & Event Database (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/), an independent, impartial, international non-profit organization collecting data on violent conflicts and protests in all countries and territories in the world. We will be superimposing these locations with the geogrpahical boundary and subdivisions of the country, from the **Myanmar Information Management Unit** (MIMU).

We are interested in conflict events from 2019 onwards - starting from a year before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2 years before the 2021 coup - cumulating into the civil war of today.

### TH1.2.1 Loading armed conflict data into `tibble` object

Here we load our *aspatial* armed conflict data into a `tibble` object.

```{r}
acled_mya <- read_csv("data/2021-01-01-2024-09-16-Southeast_Asia-Myanmar.csv")
head(acled_mya)
```

### TH1.2.2 Loading administrative boundaries into `sf` object

Three representations of Myanmar's geography exist on the MIMU repository - `Admin1` subdivides the country into its states and regions only, while `Admin2` subdivides the country by its smaller districts, and `Admin3` its townships. Further, the ACLED labels each incident with all 3 representations. For simplicity and ease of understanding, we shall use the `Admin1` representation.

```{r}
mmr_admin1 <- st_read(dsn = "data/mmr_polbnda_adm1_250k_mimu_1", layer = "mmr_polbnda_adm1_250k_mimu_1")
mmr_admin1
qtm(mmr_admin1) # Plots the national boundaries of Myanmar
```

### TH1.2.3 Creating `sf` data frame from aspatial data

The ACLED `tibble` contains coordinates, making it useful for plotting on our map as points. We can therefore use it to create an `sf` data frame using which we can plot our points on a map. The EPSG format of the import coordinates should be [`4326`](https://epsg.io/4326), corresponding to the WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System.

```{r}
acled_mya_sf <- st_as_sf(acled_mya, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)
```

## TH1.3 A brief summary of Myanmar and the Myanmar Conflict

The second largest country in Southeast Asia at 676,578 square kilometres and a member state of the **Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)**, **Myanmar** features fertile tropical deltas in the south and the rugged Himalayan foothills to its north. It shares borders with China to the north and northeast, Laos and Thailand to the east and Southeast, and Bangladesh and India to the west and northwest.

Myanmar is organised into seven **states**, seven **regions**, and one union territory - its capital, **Naypyitaw**, located at the country's centre. The following code chunk plots the administrative divisions of Myanmar into an interactive map.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(mmr_admin1) + tm_polygons()
tmap_mode('plot')
```

Crucially, Myanmar also boast significant ethnic diversity. 

## TH1.4 Data wrangling

### TH1.4.1 Coordinate system conversion

The EPSG area code for Myanmar is [`4239`](https://epsg.io/4239), while the WGS 84-compatible code is [`32647`](https://epsg.io/32647). Since we're creating an `owin` object later, we need to first convert our coordinate system.

```{r}
acled_mya_sf <- acled_mya_sf %>% st_transform(crs = 32647)
mmr_admin1 <- mmr_admin1 %>% st_transform(crs = 32647)
tm_shape(mmr_admin1) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(acled_mya_sf) + tm_dots(size = 0.05)
```

### TH1.4.2 Data cleansing

Since the data is timestamped, we are able to plot and compare the frequency of conflict events *over time*. Before we do, though, we need to standardise the date stamps, then compartmentalise them into their year, month and day components, so that we can perform spatial-temporal point patterns analysis (STPPA) later. We will also aim to segregate events by whether or not they occurred before the coup on **February 1, 2021**.

A visualisation of the spatial-temporial distribution of points can be found in **Annex A**. Notice the consistent appearance throughout the entire study period of a large cluster of points towards the west of the country - roughly the location of Rahkine state on the border with Bangladesh.

Additionally, the ACLED dataset splits the conflict incidents in **Shan state** into *North*, *South* and *East*, and incidents in the **Bago region** into *East* and *West*. We need to combine these into 

```{r}
acled_mya_sf <- acled_mya_sf %>%
    mutate(event_date = dmy(event_date)) %>%
    mutate(DayOfYear = yday(event_date)) %>%
    mutate(Month_num = format(event_date, "%Y-%m")) %>%  # Year-Month format
    mutate(Month_fac = factor(format(event_date, "%B %Y"))) %>% # Full month
    mutate(Quarter_num = ((year(event_date) - 2021) * 4) + quarter(event_date)) %>% # Numbers quarters for STKDE
    mutate(Quarter = paste(year(event_date), "-", quarter(event_date), "Q"))  %>% # Quarter format
    mutate(admin1 = case_when(
      admin1 %in% c("Shan-North", "Shan-South", "Shan-East") ~ "Shan",
      admin1 %in% c("Bago-East", "Bago-West") ~ "Bago",
      TRUE ~ admin1
    ))
acled_mya_sf
```
```{r}
admin1_unique <- unique(acled_mya_sf$admin1)
admin1_unique
```
```{r}
quarter_numbers <- unique(acled_mya_sf$Quarter_num)
quarter_numbers
```
```{r}
quarters <- unique(acled_mya_sf$Quarter) %>% unlist()
print(length(quarters))
quarters
```

```{r}
tm_shape(mmr_admin1) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(acled_mya_sf) + tm_dots(size = 0.05)
```
```{r}
tm_shape(mmr_admin1) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(acled_mya_sf) + tm_dots(size = 0.05) + tm_facets(by="Quarter_num", free.coords=FALSE, drop.units = TRUE)
```
```{r}
unique_type <- unique(acled_mya_sf$event_type)
unique_type
```

### TH1.4.3 Using `owin` to confine study area within Myanmar borders

Finally, we need to create an `owin` object that will be combined with any `ppp` objects we create later for SPPA.

```{r}
mmr_admin1_owin <- as.owin(mmr_admin1)
plot(mmr_admin1_owin)
# summary(mmr_admin1_owin)
```

## TH1.5 Performing Spatial-Temporal KDE

Our first order of business is to identify areas of consistently high conflict using spatial-temporal kernel density estimation (KDE). We can then zoom in on these areas for deeper research on why this is the case.

As always, we start by creating `ppp` objects out of our `sf` objects, and checking for duplicates.

```{r}
acled_mya_sf_quarters <- acled_mya_sf %>% select(Quarter_num)
acled_mya_quarters_ppp <- as.ppp(acled_mya_sf_quarters)
any(duplicated(acled_mya_quarters_ppp))
```

Since there are duplicates, we need to handle them using jittering.
```{r}
acled_mya_quarters_ppp <- rjitter(acled_mya_quarters_ppp, retry=TRUE, nsim=1, drop=TRUE)
any(duplicated(acled_mya_quarters_ppp))
```

Finally, we join the `owin` object mapping the borders of Myanmar to the `ppp` object.
```{r}
acled_mya_quarters_ppp <- acled_mya_quarters_ppp[mmr_admin1_owin]
plot(acled_mya_quarters_ppp)
summary(acled_mya_quarters_ppp)
```

We can now perform spatial-temporal KDE (STKDE).
```{r}
st_kde <- spattemp.density(acled_mya_quarters_ppp)
summary(st_kde)
```
After performing STKDE, we are able to plot the quarterly STKDE objects between 2021 and September 2024. The full set of plots can be found in Annex A, but the plot for Q1 2021 (id 15) is of particular interest.
```{r}
i = 15
plot(st_kde, quarter_numbers[i], override.par=FALSE, fix.range=TRUE, main=paste("Spatial-temporal KDE for", quarters[i]))
```

## TH1.6 High Conflict Areas of Interest

The preliminary KDE plot identified large clusters of armed conflict in the **Yangon** area in the south off the Andaman sea, as well as the **Saigaing** and **Chin** areas to the central-west. These indications make good candidates for further investigation.

Additionally, we will be exploring the **Rakhine** area bordering Bangladesh, and the *Kra Isthmus*, the narrow isthmus linking central Thailand to Peninsula Malaysia. Rakhine state is the epicentre of the Rohingya migrant crisis,

## TH1.5 First Order SPPA - KDE

Kernel density estimation (KDE) serves to compute the *intensity* of a point distribution. It has two general steps: first to compute the point intensity, followed by spatial interpolation using a kernel function. Using KDE, we can determine the general region of Myanmar with the highest incidence of armed conflict.

### TH1.5.1 Overall Fixed-Bandwidth KDE

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# overall_fixed_kde <- density(acled_mya_ppp.km, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel="gaussian")
# plot(overall_fixed_kde, main="Overall fixed bandwidth KDE")
```
### TH1.5.2 Overall adaptive-bandwidth KDE
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# overall_adaptive_kde <- adaptive.density(acled_mya_ppp.km, method="kernel")
# plot(overall_adaptive_kde, main="Overall adaptive bandwidth KDE")
```

### TH1.5.3 Quarterly fixed-bandwidth KDE

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Create a list to store KDE results and track quarters for each quarter
fixed_kde <- list()
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  print(quarter)
  ppp_item <- acled_ppp_list[[as.character(quarter)]]
  ppp_item <- rescale.ppp(ppp_item, 1000, "km")
  ppp_item
  # Compute KDE and append to list
  each_kde <- density(ppp_item, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel="gaussian")
  fixed_kde[[as.character(quarter)]] <- each_kde
}
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  plot(fixed_kde[[as.character(quarter)]], main = paste("Fixed bandwidth KDE for ", quarter))
}

```
### TH1.5.4 Quarterly adaptive-bandwidth KDE

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Create a list to store adaptive KDE results and track quarters for each quarter
adaptive_kde <- list()
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  print(quarter)
  ppp_item <- acled_ppp_list[[as.character(quarter)]]
  ppp_item <- rescale.ppp(ppp_item, 1000, "km")
  ppp_item
  # Compute KDE and append to list
  each_kde <- adaptive.density(ppp_item, method="kernel")
  adaptive_kde[[as.character(quarter)]] <- each_kde
}
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  plot(adaptive_kde[[as.character(quarter)]], main = paste("Adaptive bandwidth KDE for", quarter))
}
```

## TH1.6 First Order STPPA: Spatio-temporal KDE

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
acled_mya_sf_quarters <- acled_mya_sf %>% select(Quarter_num)
acled_mya_quarters_ppp <- as.ppp(acled_mya_sf_quarters)
acled_mya_quarters_ppp <- acled_mya_quarters_ppp[mmr_admin1_owin]
plot(acled_mya_quarters_ppp)

st_kde <- spattemp.density(acled_mya_quarters_ppp)
summary(st_kde)
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
for (quarter in quarters) {
  plot(st_kde, override.par=FALSE, fix.range=TRUE, main=paste("Spatial-temporal KDE for", quarter))
}
```

## TH1.7 First-order SPPA: Nearest Neighbour Analysis

To determine whether the plotted armed conflict events are clustered, dispersed or random, we can use the Clark-Evans test. Since tensions between Myanmar's different ethnic groups already existed before the 2021 coup, it would be a good idea to run the test on the subsets of data both before and after the coup.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
ppp_item <- acled_ppp_beforeAfterCoup_list[[as.character("Before")]]
print("Clark Evans Test: Before Coup")
clarkevans.test(ppp_item, correction = "none", clipregion = "mmr_admin1_owin", alternative = c("clustered"), nsim = 9)
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
ppp_item <- acled_ppp_beforeAfterCoup_list[[as.character("After")]]
print("Clark Evans Test: After Coup")
clarkevans.test(ppp_item, correction = "none", clipregion = "mmr_admin1_owin", alternative = c("clustered"), nsim = 9)
```

## TH1.7 Second-order SPPA

Second order SPPA deals with variations in observations due to the way they interact with one another. The methods used for second order SPPA are the F-, G-, K- and L-functions. In this section, we will perform second-order SPPA on the conflict dataset, applying the F-, G-, K- and L-functions on subsets of the data before and after the 2021 coup.

### TH1.7.1 F-function

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  print(quarter)
  ppp_item <- acled_ppp_beforeAfterCoup_list[[as.character(quarter)]]
  F_function <- Fest(ppp_item)
  plot(F_function, main = paste("F function for", quarter))
  
  # Perform complete spatial randomness test
  csr <- envelope(ppp_item, Fest, nsim=9)
  plot(csr, main = paste("Complete spatial randomness test for F function for", quarter))
}
```

### TH1.7.2 G-function

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  print(paste(coupStatus, " coup"))
  ppp_item <- acled_ppp_beforeAfterCoup_list[[as.character(quarter)]]
  G_function <- Gest(ppp_item, correction = "border")
  plot(G_function, xlim=c(0, 500), main = paste("G function for", quarter))
  
  # Perform complete spatial randomness test
  csr <- envelope(ppp_item, Gest, nsim=9)
  plot(csr, main = paste("Complete spatial randomness test for G function for", quarter))
}
```

### TH1.7.3 K-function

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  print(paste(coupStatus, " coup"))
  ppp_item <- acled_ppp_beforeAfterCoup_list[[as.character(quarter)]]
  K_function <- Kest(ppp_item, correction = "Ripley")
  plot(K_function, . -r ~ r, ylab= "K(d)-r", xlab = "d(m)", main = paste("K function for", quarter))
  
  # Perform complete spatial randomness test
  csr <- envelope(ppp_item, Kest, nsim=9, rank=1, glocal=TRUE)
  plot(csr, . - r ~ r, xlab="d", ylab="K(d)-r", main = paste("Complete spatial randomness test for K function for", quarter))
}
```

### TH1.7.4 L-function

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
for (quarter in selected_quarters) {
  print(paste(coupStatus," coup"))
  ppp_item <- acled_ppp_beforeAfterCoup_list[[as.character(quarter)]]
  L_function <- Lest(ppp_item, correction = "Ripley")
  plot(L_function, . -r ~ r, ylab= "L(d)-r", xlab = "d(m)", main = paste("L function for", quarter))
  
  # Perform complete spatial randomness test
  csr <- envelope(ppp_item, Kest, nsim=9, rank=1, glocal=TRUE)
  plot(csr, . - r ~ r, xlab="d", ylab="L(d)-r", main = paste("Complete spatial randomness test for L function for", quarter))
