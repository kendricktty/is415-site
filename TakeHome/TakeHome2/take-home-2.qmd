## TH2.1 Setting the Scene

Drug abuse brings with it significant negative health, financial and social consequences. Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. The UNODC has reported an increase in the number of people using illicit drugs to 292 million people worldwide in the decade leading up to 2022. Of these, 228 million people consumed cannabis, 60 million people consumed opiods, 30 million used amphetamines, 23 million used cocaine and 20 million took ecstasy. Further, they found an **increase in overdose deaths following the emergence of nitazenes**, which is a group of synthetic opioids potentially more dangerous than fentanyl â€“ in several high-income countries. (World Drug Day Report Highlights Spike in Drug Use, Increased Trafficking | UN News, 2024).

The aim of today's study is to discover:

- If the key indicators of drug abuse and trafficking in Thailand are independent from space,
- If the indicators of drug abuse and trafficking are indeed spatially-dependent, and if so, where the clusters, outliers and hotspots are located.

## TH2.2 The Drug Problem in Thailand

**[Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand)** (2024 GDP per capita - PPP: $23,401; Gini coefficient: 35.1 - <span style="color:orange;">medium</span>; HDI: 0.083 - <span style="color:darkgreen;">very high</span>) (International Monetary Fund, 2024) (World Bank, n.d.) (United Nations Development Programme, 2024) is located in close proximity to the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)), which comprises the northern part of the country along with northern Myanmar and Laos. In 2021, its drug trafficking situation remained critical, with 337,186 drug cases in total. While seizures of ketamine decreased between 2020 and 2021, seizures of methamphetamine, ice and heroin increased in the same period, with heroin seeing the biggest increase from 1873kg in 2020 to 4520kg in 2021 (Kanato et al., 2022). Considering that the *COVID-19 pandemic* - which caused a global economic depression among other socio-economic effects - occurred around this time, it can be theorised that those who encountered economic hardship as a result of the pandemic might turn to drug trafficking to support themselves and their families.

The maximum penalty for drug trafficking in Thailand, as is neighbouring Laos, Malaysia and Singapore, is [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_for_drug_trafficking) (Thailand, n.d.). Despite this, smugglers have innovated on new routes, through the north and northern borders of the country, and even go so far as to hide shipments in cargo vessels bound for the likes of Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and South Korea. 575 smuggling cases by sea occured in 2021, in which 4554kg of heroin, 2.4 times more than the previous year, were seized (Kanato et al., 2022).

Drug *use* in the country is as problematic. In 2018, 39% of Thais aged between 15 and 24 were involved in ilicit drugs. Of youth aged between 15 and 19, there are 300000 who need treatment, and a significant majority attend vocational schools (as opposed to grade schools). Kongjareon et al. (2022) found in a study of 638 students in four vocational schools, that 11.3% reported poly-drug use. Among LGBT students this figure was 20.2%, and among hetrosexual students 9.8%. Factors contributing to the former's use of drugs include, among other things, counselling needs, intoxicated sex and GPA.

## TH2.3 Importing data and R packages

The `R` packages we will use today are:

-   `sf`
-   `tmap`
-   `spatstat`
-   `spdep` for measures of spatial autocorrelation, and
-   `sparr`

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, raster, spatstat, spdep, sparr, tmap, tidyverse, gridExtra)
```

We will be examining a dataset of drug offences in Thailand between 2017 and 2022 retrieved from Kaggle, superimposed against the provincial boundaries of the country.

```{r}
thailand <- st_read(dsn="data/geospatial", layer="tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121")
thailand
thailand_drug <- read_csv("data/aspatial/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv") %>% select(fiscal_year, types_of_drug_offenses, no_cases, province_en)
thailand_drug
```

## TH2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis

The code chunk below prints the total number of each unique type of drug offence cases.

```{r}
thailand_drug_analysis <- thailand_drug %>% 
  group_by(types_of_drug_offenses) %>% 
  summarise(total_cases = sum(no_cases)) %>% ungroup()
thailand_drug_analysis
```
There are a total of 8 different types of cases, with another 8 unique values dedicated to suspected instances of cases.

We are particularly interested in drug use, possession and trafficking cases, so we will now attempt to plot the changes in the number of each type of case between 2017 and 2022. This analysis will help us select study periods to analyse later.

### TH2.4.1 Plotting changes in drug trafficking cases by time

```
The number of trafficking cases generally trended downwards between 2017 and 2022, though there was a momentary increase between 2019 and 2020. Meanwhile the number of posession cases with intent to distribute rose steadily until 2021, before plunging in 2022.

### TH2.4.2 Plotting changes in drug use cases by time

```{r}
thailand_drug_trafficking <- thailand_drug %>% filter(types_of_drug_offenses %in% c("drug_use_cases", "suspects_in_drug_use_cases", "possession_cases", "suspects_in_possession_cases")) %>%

    total_suspect_use_cases = sum(no_cases[types_of_drug_offenses == "suspects_in_drug_use_cases"]),
    total_posession_cases = sum(no_cases[types_of_drug_offenses == "possession_cases"]),
    total_suspect_posession_cases = sum(no_cases[types_of_drug_offenses == "suspects_in_possession_cases"])) %>%
  ungroup()

  geom_line(aes(x = fiscal_year, y = total_suspect_posession_cases, color = "suspects_in_possession_cases"), size = 1) + geom_point(aes(x = fiscal_year, y = total_suspect_posession_cases, color = "suspects_in_possession_cases"), size = 2) +
    labs(title = "Drug use and suspected cases by year",
         x = "Year",
         y = "Number of cases") +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("drug_use" = "skyblue1", "suspects_in_drug_use_cases" = "green3", "possession_cases" = "red2", "suspects_in_possession_cases" = "yellow3")) +
    theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Legend"))
```
There was a spike in the number of drug use cases in 2021 in an otherwise variable set of data. Meanwhile, drug possession cases generally declined after 2019, though there was a slight increase in 2021.

From both analysis steps, it makes sense to select the drug use cases trafficking cases in 2021 for further analysis. The year 2021 coincided with a rise in the country's unemployment rate to 1.2% from 0.7% two years prior (World Bank Open Data, n.d.), as the Thai economy was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment increases susceptibility to, among other negative effects, drug use.

## TH2.4.3 Creating filtered table for 2021 observations

```{r}
thailand_2021_drug <- thailand_drug %>%
  filter(fiscal_year == "2021") %>%
  filter(types_of_drug_offenses %in% c("drug_use_cases", "trafficking_cases")) %>%
  group_by(province_en) %>%
  summarise(total_use_cases = sum(no_cases[types_of_drug_offenses == "drug_use_cases"]),
            total_trafficking_cases = sum(no_cases[types_of_drug_offenses == "trafficking_cases"])) %>%
  ungroup()

thailand_2021_drug
thailand_2021 <- left_join(thailand, thailand_2021_drug, by = c("ADM1_EN" = "province_en"))
thailand_2021
```
```{r}
use_map <- tm_shape(thailand_2021) + tm_fill("total_use_cases", n = 8, style = "quantile") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) + tm_layout(main.title = "Drug use across Thailand (quantile)")
use_map_equal <- tm_shape(thailand_2021) + tm_fill("total_use_cases", n = 6, style = "equal") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) + tm_layout(main.title = "Drug use across Thailand (equal)")
tmap_arrange(use_map, use_map_equal, asp = 1, ncol = 2)
```
Considering only confirmed cases of use and trafficking (and ignoring *suspected* ones), the provinces with the highest number of drug use cases appear clustered to the northeast, around Sakon Nakhon, and north, around Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, with pockets of high use around Pattaya and the capital Bangkok near the Gulf of Thailand, and the southern provinces including Songkhla province on the border with Kedah, Malaysia. Surprisingly, provinces such as Kanchanaburi and Sing Buri see relatively muted drug use.

```{r}
trafficking_map <- tm_shape(thailand_2021) + tm_fill("total_trafficking_cases", n = 8, style = "quantile") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) + tm_layout(main.title = "Drug trafficking across Thailand (quantile)")
trafficking_map_equal <- tm_shape(thailand_2021) + tm_fill("total_trafficking_cases", n = 6, style = "equal") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) + tm_layout(main.title = "Drug trafficking across Thailand (equal)")
tmap_arrange(trafficking_map, trafficking_map_equal, asp = 1, ncol = 2)
```

The same general region also sees the highest concentration of drug *trafficking* cases throughout the country, with the eastern province of Ubon Ratchatani seeing the largest number of all.

Data for two provinces is missing, but thankfully, the Moran's I and Geary's C functions contain provisions for handling missing data.

We will now proceed to rigourously verify these observations using global and local spatial autocorrelation techniques, such as global and local Moran's I, Geary's C and G-statistics. In particular, we want to verify if the indicators of drug abuse are indeed spatially dependent, i.e. provinces that see less drug use are clustered with one another and vice-versa, and if so, whether the high-use areas identified in the choropleth maps above are indeed hot spots.

## TH2.5 Deriving Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation

Tobler's (1970) first law of geography states that everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things. Spatial autocorrelation seeks to determine the extent of Tobler's first law on a variable or measurement - in our case, the number of drug use and drug trafficking cases. As the illustration below (Khant, 2024) (Moraga, 2023) shows, positive spatial autocorrelation is when adjacent observations have similar data values. In contrast, negative spatial autocorrelation is when adjacent observations have contrasting values, and when the data values appear randomly distributed, no spatial autocorrelation occurs.

![An illustration on the methods of spatial autocorrelation. (Moraga, 2023)](moraga.png)

We will first focus on the global measures of spatial autocorrelation: Moran's I and Geary's C. While both seek to determine if the measured variables (in this case, our drug use and drug trafficking statistics) are clustered, dispersed or random, the former looks at the study area as a whole, and the latter quantifies how different each subdivision (province) is different from its immediate neighbours.

### TH2.5.1 Data Preparation - Spatial Weights

Before computing any global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we first need to construct the spatial weights of the study area. The first step in doing so will be to compute the queen contiguity spatial weights. This means we will consider all neighbours for each province that share an edge and vertex, i.e. are horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent.

We will create 2 row-standardised spatial weights matrices *for confirmed cases only* - one for our drug use statistics and another for our drug trafficking statistics. Row-standardisation will take the inverse of the number of neighbours each province has, as derived from our vanilla queen contiguity spatial weights matrix.

```{r}
thailand_2021_use <- thailand_2021 %>% select(1:3, 17)
thailand_2021_trafficking <- thailand_2021 %>% select(1:3, 18)
wm_q_use <- poly2nb(thailand_2021_use, queen=TRUE)
wm_q_tr <- poly2nb(thailand_2021_trafficking, queen=TRUE)
```
```{r}
print("Weights matrix for drug use cases")
summary(wm_q_use)
print("Weights matrix for drug trafficking cases")
summary(wm_q_tr)
```
```{r}
rswm_q_use <- nb2listw(wm_q_use, style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q_tr <- nb2listw(wm_q_tr, style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)
```
```{r}
rswm_q_use
rswm_q_tr
```
We will also define our null and alternative hypotheses as such:

- **Null Hypotheses $H_0_$: the tests indicate no spatial autocorrelation:
  - For *Moran's I*: $H_0_: I = E[I] = 0$, and;
  - For *Geary's C*:
- **Alternative Hypotheses

### TH2.5.2 Moran's I

With our matrices constructed, we can calculate our global spatial correlation statistics. Moranâ€™s I describes how features differ from the values in the study area as a whole. It approaches 1 when similar values are clustered, and approaches -1 when dissimilar values tend to cluster.

The code chunk below computes Moran's I on our *drug use* dataset, subsequently performing a Monte Carlo test and plotting the result in a histogram. We can use the histogram to visualise the permutation results and compare them to the expected value under null hypothesis.

#### TH2.5.2.1 Moran's I on `drug_use` statistics

```{r}
moran.test(thailand_2021$total_use_cases, listw=rswm_q_use, zero.policy = TRUE, na.action=na.omit)
set.seed(1234)
bperm_use <- moran.mc(thailand_2021$total_use_cases, 
                listw=rswm_q_use, 
                nsim=999, 
                zero.policy = TRUE, 
                na.action=na.omit)
bperm_use
hist(bperm_use$res, main = "Global Moran's I Simulation Results for drug_use", xlab="Monte-Carlo Results", ylab="Frequency") 
abline(v = bperm_use$statistic, col = "green4")
```
From the output above:

- The Moran's I statistic is approximately `0.21`, which is significantly higher than the expected value of `-0.014`. This is a significant indicator of positive spatial autocorrelation, but only to a moderate degree.
- With a standard deviation of `2.84` and p-value of `0.00224 < 0.05` at a 95% confidence level, the test result is statistically significant. We can reject the null hypothesis of a lack of spatial autocorrelation.
- After 1000 permutations, we get a similar Moran's I observation of `0.2081`, with a p-value of `0.003`. Therefore, our result is stable and statistically significant.

This shows that provinces with high drug use in Thailand can, to a limited extent, be near one another.

#### TH2.5.2.2 Moran's I on `drug_trafficking` statistics

```{r}
moran.test(thailand_2021$total_trafficking_cases, listw=rswm_q_tr, zero.policy = TRUE, na.action=na.omit)
set.seed(1234)
bperm_tr <- moran.mc(thailand_2021$total_trafficking_cases, 
                listw=rswm_q_tr, 
                nsim=999, 
                zero.policy = TRUE, 
                na.action=na.omit)
bperm_tr
hist(bperm_use$res, main = "Global Moran's I Simulation Results for drug_trafficking", xlab="Monte-Carlo Results", ylab="Frequency") 
abline(v = bperm_tr$statistic, col = "purple4")
```
The output for our `drug_trafficking` statistics is similar to that for our `drug_use` statistics, and can be interpreted as follows:

- The Moran's I statistic is approximately `0.22`, which is significantly higher than the expected value of `-0.014`. This value is close to that obtained from our `drug_use` statistics, which indicates that both categories of drug crimes are similarly and moderately clustered.
- With a standard deviation of `3.24` and p-value of `0.006 < 0.05` at a 95% confidence level, the test result is statistically significant. We can reject the null hypothesis of a lack of spatial autocorrelation.
- After 1000 permutations, we get a similar Moran's I observation of `0.21947`, with a p-value of `0.008`. Therefore, our result is stable and statistically significant.

Like drug use, using Moran's I show that provinces with high drug trafficking in Thailand can, to a limited extent, be near one another.

## TH2.6 Geary's C

Geary's C is another measure of global spatial autocorrelation that describes how features differ from their immediate neighbours. When `C > 1`, the points are dispersed, and while `C < 1`, the points are clustered. A `C` value of `1` indicates observations are randomly arranged in space. Gearyâ€™s C approaches `0` when similar values are clustered, and approaches `3` when dissimilar values are clustered. Gearyâ€™s C is inversely proportional to Moranâ€™s I, so higher Cs correspond to lower Is.

Just as before, we will now perform Geary's C on both our `drug_use` and `drug_trafficking` statistics.

### TH2.6.1 Geary's C on `drug_use` statistics

```{r}
geary.test(thailand_2021$total_use_cases, listw=rswm_q_use, zero.policy = TRUE, na.action = na.omit)
set.seed(1234)
bperm_use <- geary.mc(thailand_2021$total_use_cases, 
                listw=rswm_q_use, 
                nsim=999,
                zero.policy = TRUE,
                na.action = na.omit)
bperm_use
hist(bperm_use$res, main = "Geary's C Simulation Results for drug_use", xlab="Monte-Carlo Results", ylab="Frequency") 
abline(v = bperm_use$statistic, col = "green4")
```
From the output above:

- The Geary's C statistic is approximately `0.84`, which is lower than the expected value of `1.0`. Just as a high Moran's I indicates positive spatial correlation, our Geary's C statistic, which is less than `1`, indicates likewise. Similarly to the conclusion of our Moran's I investigation, the Geary's C statistic only indicates moderate positive spatial correlation.
- With a standard deviation of `3.24 and p-value of `0.04 < 0.05`, the test result is statistically significant. If we were to only run the test once, we should be able to reject the null hypothesis of a lack of spatial autocorrelation.
- However, while running 1000 permutations yielded a similar Geary's C observation of `0.84412`, this time, our p-value of `0.072` is *greater* than our threshold of `0.05` at the 95% confidence level. Had we only used Geary's C, we would not have strong statistical evidence to reject our null hypothesis.

Hence, the Geary's C statistic on drug use cases in 2021 yielded inconclusive results.

### TH2.6.2 Geary's C on `drug_trafficking` statistics

```{r}
geary.test(thailand_2021$total_trafficking_cases, listw=rswm_q_tr, zero.policy = TRUE, na.action = na.omit)
set.seed(1234)
bperm_tr <- geary.mc(thailand_2021$total_trafficking_cases, 
                listw=rswm_q_tr, 
                nsim=999, zero.policy = TRUE, na.action = na.omit)
bperm_tr
hist(bperm_use$res, main = "Global Geary's C Simulation Results for drug_trafficking", xlab="Monte-Carlo Results", ylab="Frequency") 
abline(v = bperm_tr$statistic, col = "purple4")
```
When Geary's C is run on the `drug_trafficking` statistics:

- The result yielded is approximately `0.74`, which is lower than the expected value of `1.0`. It is also lower than the Geary's C for the drug use data, which indicates that the clustering of drug trafficking hotspots is stronger than that for drug use.
- With a standard deviation of `2.28` and p-value of `0.01 < 0.05` for a 95% confidence level, the test result is statistically significant. If we were to only run the test once, we should be able to reject the null hypothesis of a lack of spatial autocorrelation.
- Now, running 1000 permutations yielded a similar Geary's C observation of `0.74184` and a p-value of `0.043` is less than our threshold of `0.05` at the 95% confidence level. Even though the p-value is uncomfortably close to the threshold, we can still conclude that our derived Geary's C for our drug trafficking data is statistically significant.

Hence, the Geary's C measure on drug trafficking cases in 2021 indicates mild positive spatial autocorrelation, albeit stronger than that observed on our drug use statistics.

## TH2.7 Deriving Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation

Both Global Moran's I and Geary's C only return a surface observation on how Thailand's drug crime is distributed by province. To identify where the clusters are located, we need to use local indicators of spatial association (LISA), which indicate the extent of spatial clustering around each observation (Anselin, 1995) (Khant, 2024). 

An example of a LISA is local Moran's I, which is essentially Moran's I calculated for each geographical subdivision, in this case the provinces of Thailand. However, with these localised measures, we are able to visualise our findings on a choropleth map, and move on to detect hot and cold spot areas.

As before, we will derive the local Moran's I statistics for both our drug trafficking and drug use data.
