## TH3.1 Introduction

The objective of Take-Home Exercise 3 is to prototype a module to be built for the Geospatial Analytics project, which is on building a hedonic pricing model for house prices in Johor Bahru. As the group member in charge of building the model itself, I have decided to base this exercise on the geographically weighted regression model. 

At the time of writing, my group has yet to complete acquiring our dataset, so the regression model for this exercise will instead be used to model **[HDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing_in_Singapore) resale prices in 2023**.
